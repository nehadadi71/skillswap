## Supabase Configuration

This project uses Supabase for authentication and database functionality. The Supabase connection is already configured with the following parameters in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`:

```typescript
const SUPABASE_URL = "https://ercsjuuyfyokjgkveeev.supabase.co";
const SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImVyY3NqdXV5Znlva2pna3ZlZWV2Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDMwODYyMDcsImV4cCI6MjA1ODY2MjIwN30.HuJ5uEtQh5DtxZ696sBvSU0K1T7UQYcVIhBs7mwnouM";
```

These values will work as-is when you deploy the project. The database connection will continue to function correctly in both development and production environments.

## How to Deploy to Google IDX (Firebase)

This project can be easily deployed to Google IDX (Firebase Hosting). Here's how:

1. **Install Firebase CLI**

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

2. **Log in to Firebase**

```bash
firebase login
```

3. **Initialize Firebase in your project**

```bash
firebase init
```

Select Firebase Hosting, and follow the prompts:
- Set "dist" as your public directory (this is where Vite builds to)
- Configure as a single-page app
- Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub (optional)

4. **Build your project**

```bash
npm run build
```

5. **Deploy to Firebase**

```bash
firebase deploy
```

Your app will be available at the Firebase URL provided after deployment.

## Setting up Gemini AI

To use the AI profile matching feature:

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)
2. Add the API key when prompted in the AI Matching tab
3. For production, store the API key in your Supabase environment variables

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain then we recommend using Netlify or Firebase Hosting. Visit our docs for more details: [Custom domains](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain/)
